Linear Regression from GA

We'll be working with a data set from Capital Bikeshare that was used in a Kaggle competition (data dictionary).

The objective of the competition is to predict total ridership of Capital Bikeshare in any given hour.

Demand forecasting is a common data science application. If we can predict the quantity of demand, total ridership in a given hour, we can create analytical tools to improve the bikeshare system. Some applications would be:

Find where to site new bikeshare stations and know how large of a station to build.
Calculate the expected wear and tear on bikes and what the replacement costs will be.
Use a slightly different research design to forecast full and empty stations and send a service vehicle to "rebalance" the bikes from one station to another, as sometimes bikeshare stations have no bikes or are completely full and prevent use of the station.
Businesses aren't new to demand forecasting, but older methods suffered from poor predictions at atypical small locations. Modern approaches incorporate clusters and online data from Twitter and Google Trends to improve prediction in these small locations.
